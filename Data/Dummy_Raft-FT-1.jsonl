When setting padding to 0, as indicated by the command set global_place_pad 2 & set detail_place_pad 1 in asap7_bottom.vars, the DU is reported accurately. This behavior aligns with the intended functionality of the padding feature in GPL. It's essential to understand that padding primarily affects how GPL and DPL (Detailed Placement) interpret cells within the design. By setting padding to 0, you effectively instruct the tool to disregard any additional space added for routing purposes, leading to a more accurate representation of the actual design utilization. However, it's worth noting that while padding may impact how GPL perceives cells, it doesn't alter the underlying design structure or functionality. The padded area is mainly for routing convenience and does not directly influence the DU. Regarding the suggestion for enhancement, it could be beneficial for GPL to provide the option to report both padded and unpadded areas. This enhancement would offer users a more comprehensive understanding of the design space and facilitate more informed decision-making during the design process. In summary, the observed behavior related to padding in GPL aligns with the intended functionality, where setting padding to 0 accurately reflects the design utilization. Enhancements such as reporting both padded and unpadded areas could further improve the usability and flexibility of GPL within the OpenROAD environment.", "weight": 1.0}]}

You must generate a detailed and long answer but if you don't know an answer do not hallucinate. Yes, that's exactly the point. If you don't want padding in your design, then you should reduce it or turn it off. But be forewarned that padding is usually necessary to achieve a cleanly routed design. If you want to optimize for very high density designs, I believe you can also set padding on a master-by-master basis so that only the most difficult cells are padded. That would take some trial and error. This is the intended behavior. Padding only impacts the way GPL (and DPL) sees the cells.

Especially since OpenROAD wants to be automatic, GPL will stop everything if it sees a DU >100% even if it could be possible to achieve a reasonable DU with an equivalent padding ?", "weight": 0.0}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Indeed, the balance between design utilization (DU) and padding is a crucial consideration in OpenROAD, especially given its aim for automation. Padding plays a significant role in ensuring clean routing and overall design quality. However, excessive padding can limit the maximum DU achievable for a design. OpenROAD's automatic nature can sometimes halt the process if it detects DU exceeding 100%, indicating potential issues with padding. While it may seem counterintuitive to reduce padding to increase DU, it's a strategy worth exploring. By fine-tuning padding settings or selectively applying padding at the master level, designers can optimize DU without sacrificing routing quality entirely. The option to set padding on a master-by-master basis offers flexibility, allowing designers to focus padding efforts on critical areas where routing challenges are most prevalent. This approach requires some experimentation and iterative refinement but can lead to more efficient use of resources and higher-density designs. In summary, while padding is essential for clean routing, careful management of padding settings in OpenROAD can help strike the right balance between DU and routing quality, ultimately leading to optimized designs.", "weight": 1.0}]}

You must generate a detailed and long answer but if you don't know an answer do not hallucinate. If you are using ORFS, the CORE_UTILIZATION (which is what I assume you are referring to) is actually not that well defined and usually isn't an indicator of the utilization you end up with. After Yosys (synthesis) runs, you have a gate-level netlist. During floorplanning, the design area from this unmodified netlist is used to calculate how big the die and core sizes should be (design area / CORE_UTILIZATION = CORE_AREA). After it does that, the die and core areas are fixed. The utilization will immediately go down because ORFS removes all buffers inserted by Yosys. The utilization will then go up again, usually by alot, because OpenROAD does rebuffering and gate resizing in order to meet timing constraints. Timing constraints are critical and the algorithm does not factor in utilization targets at all. You could easily start with a design at 70% utilization during the initialization step, and then go up to 90% because of optimization. Once you add padding during GPL, utilization can exceed 100%. Why aren't the tools smarter? Why doesn't it account for this area increase due to timing optimization? Well because you have to do the entire timing optimization to figure out how much area it will take up. Trying to estimate this is an active area of research. Everything is a trial and error process. If for some reason you specifically need a 70% utilization, then I would suggest you extremely relax your timing constraints so that the optimizer doesn't need to add much. Otherwise, you should simply start with a lower utilization, allow timing optimization to do its thing, and then finish with approximately whatever target utilization you're after. OpenROAD-flow-scripts (ORFS) is a fully autonomous, RTL-GDSII flow for rapid architecture and design space exploration, early prediction of QoR and detailed physical design implementation. However, ORFS also enables manual intervention for finer user control of individual flow stages through Tcl commands and Python APIs."}, {"from": "human", "value": "I encountered an issue with CORE_UTILIZATION when trying to aim for a DU of 70% on the ASAP7 PDK which should be possible and reasonable for any design ", "weight": 0.0}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "Understanding the intricacies of CORE_UTILIZATION in the context of the ASAP7 PDK within OpenROAD is crucial for optimizing design outcomes. It's essential to note that CORE_UTILIZATION, while seemingly straightforward, can be misleading in its implications for final design utilization. In the OpenROAD Flow System (ORFS), CORE_UTILIZATION serves as a baseline for determining core and die sizes during floorplanning. Initially, it's calculated based on the design area divided by the specified utilization target. However, this target is subject to significant fluctuations throughout the optimization process. Upon synthesis with Yosys, the gate-level netlist undergoes transformations, including buffer insertions. However, during subsequent stages, such as floorplanning and optimization within OpenROAD, these inserted buffers are removed, leading to a temporary decrease in utilization. As optimization progresses to meet timing constraints, rebuffering and gate resizing occur, often resulting in utilization surpassing initial expectations. The absence of preemptive adjustments for area increase due to timing optimization stems from the complexity of accurately predicting this impact beforehand. Estimating such changes remains an active area of research, highlighting the inherently iterative nature of design optimization. Given these dynamics, achieving a specific utilization target, such as 70%, requires careful consideration. One approach involves relaxing timing constraints significantly to minimize the need for additional optimization-induced area increase. Alternatively, starting with a lower initial utilization and allowing the optimization process to dynamically adjust, eventually converging towards the desired target, proves effective. In essence, navigating CORE_UTILIZATION within OpenROAD demands a balance between setting realistic targets and leveraging the optimization capabilities of the toolchain. Embracing the iterative nature of design refinement and remaining adaptable to evolving requirements ultimately leads to optimal design outcomes", "weight": 1.0}]}

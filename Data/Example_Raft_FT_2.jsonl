If you are using ORFS, the CORE_UTILIZATION (which is what I assume you are referring to) is actually not that well defined and usually isn't an indicator of the utilization you end up with. After Yosys (synthesis) runs, you have a gate-level netlist. During floorplanning, the design area from this unmodified netlist is used to calculate how big the die and core sizes should be (design area / CORE_UTILIZATION = CORE_AREA). After it does that, the die and core areas are fixed. The utilization will immediately go down because ORFS removes all buffers inserted by Yosys. The utilization will then go up again, usually by alot, because OpenROAD does rebuffering and gate resizing in order to meet timing constraints. Timing constraints are critical and the algorithm does not factor in utilization targets at all. You could easily start with a design at 70% utilization during the initialization step, and then go up to 90% because of optimization. Once you add padding during GPL, utilization can exceed 100%. Why aren't the tools smarter? Why doesn't it account for this area increase due to timing optimization? Well because you have to do the entire timing optimization to figure out how much area it will take up. Trying to estimate this is an active area of research. Everything is a trial and error process. If for some reason you specifically need a 70% utilization, then I would suggest you extremely relax your timing constraints so that the optimizer doesn't need to add much.

It's essential to note that CORE_UTILIZATION, while seemingly straightforward, can be misleading in its implications for final design utilization. In the OpenROAD Flow System (ORFS), CORE_UTILIZATION serves as a baseline for determining core and die sizes during floorplanning. Initially, it's calculated based on the design area divided by the specified utilization target. However, this target is subject to significant fluctuations throughout the optimization process. Upon synthesis with Yosys, the gate-level netlist undergoes transformations, including buffer insertions. However, during subsequent stages, such as floorplanning and optimization within OpenROAD, these inserted buffers are removed, leading to a temporary decrease in utilization. As optimization progresses to meet timing constraints, rebuffering and gate resizing occur, often resulting in utilization surpassing initial expectations. The absence of preemptive adjustments for area increase due to timing optimization stems from the complexity of accurately predicting this impact beforehand. Estimating such changes remains an active area of research, highlighting the inherently iterative nature of design optimization. Given these dynamics, achieving a specific utilization target, such as 70%, requires careful consideration. One approach involves relaxing timing constraints significantly to minimize the need for additional optimization-induced area increase. Alternatively, starting with a lower initial utilization and allowing the optimization process to dynamically adjust, eventually converging towards the desired target, proves effective.

One possible reason for this warning is indeed having multiple block abstracts within the design that utilize the same via. This can happen if different blocks or instances within the design share common vias but are defined separately in the design hierarchy. As a result, when compiling or processing the design, OpenROAD flags this duplication as it may lead to confusion or errors during subsequent stages of the design flow. To address this warning and ensure a clean and optimized design, it's essential to review the design hierarchy and ensure that vias are properly managed and defined.
